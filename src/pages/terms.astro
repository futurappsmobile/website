          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Risk of Error ("Hallucinations"):</strong> AI can make mistakes. It may identify a "tomato" as an "apple," or suggest a recipe containing ingredients you did not possess.</li>
            <li><strong>Allergy Warning:</strong> The AI may fail to identify allergens. If you upload a photo of a product containing nuts, the AI might not warn you. You are solely responsible for checking all ingredients for allergies before consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Edibility:</strong> The AI may suggest recipes that are not palatable or technically feasible. Use your own judgment when cooking.</li>
